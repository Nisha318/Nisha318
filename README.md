# Hi, I'm Nisha 👋

**Cloud Security Engineer | GRC Engineering | Security Automation**

I'm a cybersecurity professional specializing in bridging compliance frameworks with cloud security automation. I build security controls as code, automate vulnerability remediation, and implement policy-driven security architectures in AWS and Azure environments.

Currently: Senior Cyber Security Engineer supporting cloud-hosted systems | CISSP | AWS Solutions Architect Associate
